# ‚öîÔ∏è Battle Simulator Game

Welcome to the **Battle Simulator**, a real-time strategy game where two armies clash on a battlefield. Customize your soldiers, manage resources, and watch the action unfold as your troops battle for victory. This game is built using **React**, featuring dynamic animations, custom AI behaviors, and a visually immersive battlefield UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/battle-simulator-game.git
    cd battle-simulator-game
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you will see lint errors (if any) in the console.

## üéÆ Gameplay

In **Battle Simulator**, two armies are generated with customizable stats like health, damage, speed, and morale. Watch them fight in real-time on a battlefield!

- **Blue Army vs Red Army**: Both teams have a set number of soldiers. The goal is to defeat the enemy army by either eliminating all soldiers or forcing them to retreat by lowering their morale.
- **Control Soldiers' Stats**: Adjust health, speed, and damage values for each army to change the tide of battle.
- **Victory Conditions**: Victory is declared when one side completely defeats the other.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the game in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. The build is optimized and minified for the best performance. The production-ready app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This will help you ensure your game logic works correctly.

## üñºÔ∏è Visuals and Customization

The game is styled using **Tailwind CSS**, which gives the game a sleek, modern look while keeping the codebase modular and easy to customize. If you‚Äôd like to adjust the game‚Äôs UI or add new features, feel free to modify the existing components or add new ones.

- **Battlefield Background**: The battlefield is rendered with a dynamic background image to simulate a realistic battle environment.
- **Soldier Animations**: Soldiers react to different states (attacking, retreating, celebrating victory) with smooth animations.
- **Victory Screen**: Displays a dramatic victory screen when one army wins the battle.
